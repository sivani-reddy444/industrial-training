    <br>This page was last modified on Jul 17, 2023 by MDN contributors. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
    <br>HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS.
    <br>Another feature of HTML is that it can interact with your operating system, not just with your web browser. These features make it possible to drag files onto a web page to upload them, full-screen a video, and more. What careers use HTML? As the language of the Internet, every aspiring web developer needs to know HTML.</p>
